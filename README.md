# ChatGPT
My first project trying to learn a bit about ChatGPT while dabbling more with Python. This is an application that takes 
* A Tamil sentence as input via a Mic
* Converts it to English
* Sends the English text to OpenAI API
* Gets the response
* Translates the response back into Tamil. 
* Sends the Tamil response to the speaker
